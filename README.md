In this part, we developed 3 web pages, that will be used as the interface of a client, using the site with a browser.
We developed 3 pages: Login page, Registration page and web-app page.
For this project, these are only a mock of the site and it's requirements presented to us.

Login page and Registration pages allow to move between them, if a user already exists, or would like to register a new account.

We used Bootstrap 5 as our technology to design the pages, content and visual effects.

How to use:
Download all of the files, extract them to a location of your choosing.
**Everything must be in the same directory**
Then, run the login.html page w/ double click
